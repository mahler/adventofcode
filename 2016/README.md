# Advent of Code, 2016

This folder contains solutions to [Advent of Code 2016](https://adventofcode.com/2016) written in "pure" [Go](https://golang.org/) - using online go and the Go Standard library.

The code here was developed as part of my path to learning the Go programming language. It's generally
written to be readable and expressive, and as new to go, it may not be [idiomatic Go code](https://dave.cheney.net/2020/02/23/the-zen-of-go).
