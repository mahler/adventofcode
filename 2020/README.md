# Fun with Advent of code, 2020 
This repository contains solutions in Go for https://adventofcode.com/2020/
The development was done in Go 1.15.6.

As I'm still new to Go some functions and constructs may have been copied 
from elsewhere and adapted. If so, you sould find a URL referencing the source.

All code is developed as "pure Go" - that's is without dependencies to anything
beyond what's found in the Standard Library whenever possible (if not always).
