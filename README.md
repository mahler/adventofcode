# Advent of code

This repo contains solutions to Advent of code challenges. This is not a complete set, as I'm still working to solve tasks across every year.

I am using the AoC to learn and practice Go development.

Table markers:

* X task (all parts) solved and committed
* / task partially solved and comitted
* o working on task
* Z task solved but not comitted (due to shamefully ugly code needing recfactoring before commit)
