# Advent of code

This repo contains solutions to Advent of code challenges. This is not a complete set, as I'm still working to solve tasks across every year.

I am using the AoC to learn and practice Go development.

SPOILER WARNING: The README file with task description includes the solutions.
Beware: No code here is suited for production use.

## Support tools used to develop these solutions
